# ROEGen@RecSys’24: The 1st International Workshop on Risks, Opportunities, and Evaluation of Generative Models in Recommendation Systems

## Abstract

This workshop explores the exciting yet challenging realm of generative models within recommender systems. It highlights their potential to revolutionize personalization, content creation, and user interaction while addressing critical challenges like bias, misinformation, privacy issues, and environmental impacts. The "ROEGen@RecSys" workshop aims to foster a thorough examination of these technologies, discussing strategies to mitigate risks and harness opportunities for ethical and sustainable innovation.

## Motivation

The integration of Large Language Models (RecLLMs), multimodal foundation models like Gemini, and image generation models such as Sora introduces a myriad of possibilities for recommender systems. These models enhance the personalization capabilities of RS, extend knowledge through interaction, and significantly improve the user experience with dynamic and conversational interfaces. However, they also introduce substantial challenges such as biases and privacy concerns, necessitating a comprehensive discussion on their ethical and practical implications.

## Workshop Themes and Objectives

### 1. **Risks and Challenges**
   - Focuses on identifying potential risks like misinformation and biases, particularly from advanced image generation models. 
   - Discusses privacy implications and technical challenges in achieving transparency and user control.

### 2. **Opportunities and Applications**
   - Highlights the transformative potential of LLMs and generative models in RS, enhancing user interaction and content discoverability.
   - Explores novel applications across sectors like entertainment, fashion, and healthcare, demonstrating their broad utility.

### 3. **Evaluation and Mitigation**
   - Dedicated to developing methodologies to assess the efficacy, fairness, and security of these models.
   - Encourages the creation of new benchmarks and evaluation metrics that provide a comprehensive view of model performance.
